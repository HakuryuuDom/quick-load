# quick-load
tera-proxy module to bypass loading screens

# config
loadDistance: The maximum distance at which same-zone loading screens will be ignored.
loadExtra: Attempt to quick-load same zones beyond loadDistance.
loadExtraMs: Increase this if you experience falling due to collision maps taking too long to load.
blockedZones: Some zones behave weirdly if the loading screen is skipped, add it here to disable the mod for that zone. (ie Harrowhold)
skipCutscenes: Set to true if you wish to skip problematic cutscenes
skipCutscenesZones: List of zones that should have their cutscenes skipped. (ie RKNM, RKHM)
