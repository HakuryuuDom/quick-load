# quick-load
tera-proxy module to bypass loading screens when teleporting into nearby areas

# Command
ql, quickload: turns the module on or off.

ql safe: toggles safe mode, this setting is on by default and can prevent spawning inder the map. Not fully tested, disable if it causes issues.

# config
loadDistance: The maximum distance at which same-zone loading screens will be ignored.

loadExtra: Disable this if you experience too many bugs. This will remove loading screens only when switching channels or teleporting extremely short distances.

loadExtraMs: Increase this if you experience falling due to collision maps taking too long to load.

blockedZones: Some zones behave weirdly if the loading screen is skipped, add it here to disable the mod for that zone. (ie Harrowhold)
