# quick-load
tera-proxy module to bypass loading screens when teleporting into nearby areas

# Requirements
Requires Caali's proxy https://discord.gg/maqBmJV (or ask Pinkie to merge Caali's core changes into his proxy.)

# Command
ql, quickload: turns the module on or off.

# config
loadDistance: The maximum distance at which same-zone loading screens will be ignored.

loadExtra: Disable this if you experience too many bugs. This will remove loading screens only when switching channels or teleporting extremely short distances.

loadExtraMs: Increase this if you experience falling due to collision maps taking too long to load.

blockedZones: Some zones behave weirdly if the loading screen is skipped, add it here to disable the mod for that zone. (ie Harrowhold)

skipCutscenes: Set to true if you wish to skip problematic cutscenes. Disabled by default.

skipCutscenesZones: List of zones that should have their cutscenes skipped. (ie RKNM, RKHM)

# Known Issues
Does not work in Northern Shara zones. thanks BHS
